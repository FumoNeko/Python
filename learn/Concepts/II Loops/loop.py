# For some reason, computer scientists call loops and looping "iteration"
# If you hear any form of the word "iterate" just know that it means to loop

# For Loop (loop a certain number of times)
for i in range(6):
    print(i) # => "0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5"

for i in range (1, 6):
    print(i) # => "1, 2, 3, 4, 5"

# For loop with table (loop through a table/array)
table = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for i in fruits
    print(i)

# While Loop (loop until a condition is met)
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1 # => "1, 2, 3, 4, 5"
