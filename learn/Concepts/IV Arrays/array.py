# Most data structures can be called arrays
# There are 4 main types of data structures in python:

# Sets
# Dictionaries
# Tuples
# Lists

# The "tables" we are familiar with from lua are called "lists"

cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"] # => New table called cars.

x = cars[0] # => x = "Ford"

cars[0] = "Toyota" # => Replaces "Ford" with "Toyota"

x = len(cars) # => returns number of elements in cars table
